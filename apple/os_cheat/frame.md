What is thrashing in OS

Page Frame Management
We saw in the section "Paging in Hardware" in Chapter 2 how the Intel Pentium processor can use two different page frame sizes: 4 KB and 4 MB (or 2 MB if PAE is enabledâ€”see the section "The Physical Address Extension (PAE) Paging Mechanism" in Chapter 2). Linux adopts the smaller 4 KB page frame size as the standard memory allocation unit. This makes things simpler for two reasons:

The Page Fault exceptions issued by the paging circuitry are easily interpreted. Either the page requested exists but the process is not allowed to address it, or the page does not exist. In the second case, the memory allocator must find a free 4 KB page frame and assign it to the process.

Although both 4 KB and 4 MB are multiples of all disk block sizes, transfers of data between main memory and disks are in most cases more efficient when the smaller size is used.
