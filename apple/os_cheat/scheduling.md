What is a Scheduling Algorithm? Name different types of scheduling algorithms.


A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU


First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
Priority Scheduling
Shortest Remaining Time
Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling


The major difference between the short-term scheduler and the long-term scheduler is that the long-term scheduler selects processes from the job pool and places them in the ready queue and on the contrary, the short -term scheduler selects processes from the ready queue and assigned them CPU for execution.  The followings are some popular scheduling algorithms:
