We can observe from the output above that it takes two steps to create a process:

The clone system call creates the process as a clone of the bash process
The execve system call then replaces the executable in the process with the ls command binary
Another important point is that even though we say the child process is a copy/clone of the parent with the same address space, implementation-wise, Linux does not copy the childâ€™s memory until the child writes. This clever implementation of the process in Linux saves RAM space and avoids unnecessary memory allocation. This implementation is also called Copy on Write (COW).
