What's the Difference Between TLS and SSL?
As mentioned earlier, the main difference you notice between both protocols is how they establish connections. TLS handshake uses an implicit way of establishing a connection via a protocol, while SSL makes explicit connections with a port.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the latest version of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Both protocols ensure data privacy and authenticity over the internet. These widely used protocols provide end-to-end security by applying encryption for web-based communication. However, despite the similarities of TLS and SSL, they have significant differences, too.



SSL	TLS
SSL is a complex protocol to implement.	TLS is a simpler protocol.
SSL has three versions, of which SSL 3.0 is the latest.	TLS has four versions, of which the TLS 1.3 version is the latest
All SSL protocol versions are vulnerable to attacks.	TLS protocol offers high security.
SSL uses a message authentication code (MAC) after message encryption for data integrity	TLS uses a hash-based message authentication code in its record protocol.
SSL uses message digest to create a master secret.	TLS employs a pseudo-random function to create a master secret.
