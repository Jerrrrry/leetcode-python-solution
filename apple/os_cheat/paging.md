Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non â€“ contiguous.

Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space( represented in words or bytes): The set of all logical addresses generated by a program
Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually available on memory unit
Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes): The set of all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses


A page fault is an interruption that occurs when a software program attempts to access a memory block not currently stored in the system's RAM. This exception tells the operating system to find the block in virtual memory so it can be sent from a device's storage (SSD or HD) to RAM.


5.4. 3. Page Faults
Check the location of the referenced page in the PMT.
If a page fault occured, call on the operating system to fix it.
Using the frame replacement algorithm, find the frame location.
Read the data from disk to memory.
Update the page map table for the process.
