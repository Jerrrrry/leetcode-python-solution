Complexity

Time: O(N * 26 * W^2 + A), where N <= 1000 is number of words in wordList, W <= 5 is length of each words, A is total number of sequences.
BFS costs O(E + V), where E is number of edges, V is number of vertices.
Because words need to be existed in the wordList, so there is total N words, it's also the number of vertices.
To find neighbors for a word, it costs O(26 * W * W), in the worst case, we have to find the neighbors of N words, so there is total O(N * 26 * W^2) edges.
Space: O(N*W + A)
